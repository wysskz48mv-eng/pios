# PIOS Changelog

## v2.0.0 — 2026-Q1 (Expenses inline edit + Admin env checklist)

### New Features
- **Expenses inline edit** (`src/app/platform/expenses/page.tsx` +40L) [commit 8f3bebf] — Click any expense description to edit in-place. Enter saves; Escape cancels. PATCH to Supabase with optimistic local update. Edit mode shows ✓ save + ✕ cancel; view mode shows ✎ edit + ✕ delete. Previously expenses could only be deleted and re-added to fix errors.

- **Admin env checklist — two new vars** (`src/app/platform/admin/page.tsx`) [commit 8f3bebf] — `SUPABASE_IS_SERVICE_KEY` (optional, IS live data in Command Centre) and `CRON_SECRET` (required, Bearer auth for `/api/cron/brief`) added to the Vercel env vars checklist. Without `CRON_SECRET` the morning brief cron fires but returns 401 and generates nothing.

## v1.9.0 — 2026-Q1 (Morning Brief Cron + vercel.json)

### New Features
- **Morning Brief Cron** (`src/app/api/cron/brief/route.ts` — 116L) [commit 674b577] — `GET /api/cron/brief` runs daily at 06:00 UTC (08:00 Dubai / 07:00 London). Fetches all `user_profiles` (cap 50), skips users who already have today's brief, generates brief via Claude for remaining users using the same prompt as `POST /api/brief`, upserts to `daily_briefs` with `generated_by='cron'`. Requires `CRON_SECRET` env var (Bearer auth). Returns `{ok, date, skipped, generated, errors, results}`. Users who forget to trigger their brief manually now receive it automatically before their workday starts.

- **`vercel.json`** [commit 674b577] — Vercel cron schedule `0 6 * * *` wired to `/api/cron/brief`. Function timeouts: `brief` 60s, `cron/brief` 300s (multi-user batch), `ai/**` 60s, `research/**` 60s, `live/**` 30s.

### Platform Scale
- **21 pages · 35 routes** (+1: /api/cron/brief)

---

## v1.8.0 — 2026-Q1 (Zero Blocking Dialogs)

### Fixes
- **confirm() → inline two-step guards** [commit 5c58c69] — Eliminates all synchronous blocking browser dialogs. `command/page.tsx`: `handleDeleteFeed` now requires two clicks using `deleteFeedConfirm` state (arm → execute pattern, no modal needed). `files/page.tsx`: `deleteRule` gated by same two-step pattern with `deleteRuleConfirm` state. `research/page.tsx`: watchlist/library remove actions use explicit `window.confirm()` where inline state restructuring would be disproportionate. PIOS now has zero unintentional native `alert()` / `confirm()` blocking calls.

---

## v1.7.0 — 2026-Q1 (Stripe Billing Portal)

### New Features
- **Stripe Customer Portal** (`src/app/api/stripe/portal/route.ts` — 52L) [commit 9792e7a] — `GET /api/stripe/portal` creates a Stripe Customer Portal session and redirects the authenticated user to Stripe's hosted billing management page. Handles: no Stripe customer (redirect with `billing=not_subscribed`), Stripe API errors (redirect with `billing=error`). Return URL: `/platform/settings?billing=returned`.

- **Settings page billing management** (`src/app/platform/settings/page.tsx`) [commit 9792e7a] — Added 'Manage subscription →' button, shown only when `tenant.stripe_customer_id` exists (active subscriber). Subtitle: "Update payment method · Cancel · View invoices". Added `billing` URL param handler in `useEffect`: `?billing=returned` → green banner; `?billing=error` → red banner; `?billing=not_subscribed` → red banner. URL param cleaned after reading via `window.history.replaceState`. Previously: no mechanism for paid subscribers to cancel, update payment, or view invoices.

### Platform Scale
- **21 pages** (+1: implicitly through settings enhancement) · **33 routes** (+1: /api/stripe/portal)

## v1.6.0 — 2026-Q1 (Google Auth + UX Fixes)

### Fixes
- **Google reconnect always shown** (`src/app/platform/settings/page.tsx`) [commit b08d054] — Previously the 'Connect Google Account' button only appeared when `profile.google_email` was null (not connected). Problem: users who had connected Google before `gmail.modify` scope was added to the OAuth flow could not grant the new scope without reconnecting — the button was hidden. Now: button is always visible, label changes based on state: Connected → `'↻ Reconnect Google (refresh scopes)'` / Not connected → `'Connect Google Account'`. Both use `prompt: 'consent' + access_type: 'offline'` to force full scope re-grant and new refresh token issuance. Required for Gmail API send + Calendar sync to work for existing users.

- **alert() → inline banner notifications** [commit e81456b] — Replaced all `alert()` dialogs with non-blocking inline banner notifications. `alert()` is synchronous, browser-blocking, and fails for users with popup blockers. All PIOS notifications now use the inline banner pattern already established in the dashboard.

---

## v1.5.0 — 2026-Q1 (Citation Guard Sprint)

### New Features
- **Citation Guard Library** (`src/lib/citation-guard.ts` — 260L) [commit f010c09] — Shared verification library for all PIOS AI academic outputs. 6-step pipeline:
  - **Step 1:** CrossRef DOI existence check (REST API, 6s timeout)
  - **Step 2:** Wayback Machine snapshot availability check
  - **Step 3:** Fuzzy title/author metadata matching vs CrossRef record
  - **Step 4:** Confidence scoring 0–100: +40 DOI exists, +30 title exact/+15 close/-20 mismatch, +15 author confirmed/+5 partial/-15 mismatch, +10 year match, +10 Wayback available, capped at 20 if no DOI/URL
  - **Step 5:** HITL gate — flags when confidence <40 or metadata mismatch
  - **Step 6:** `ProvenanceLabel`: `AI_VERIFIED` | `AI_UNVERIFIED` | `FABRICATED_RISK`
  - `verifyCitations(citations[])` → `GuardReport` with summary counts
  - `provenanceBadge(label)` → text/colour/bg for UI rendering

- **Research Verify Route** (`/api/research/verify` — new) [commit f010c09] — `POST /api/research/verify` — batch citation verification endpoint. Max 30 citations per request. Returns full `GuardReport`.

- **Research Search Prompt Upgrade** (`/api/research/search`) [commit f010c09] — System prompt upgraded: Claude now instructed NOT to fabricate DOIs, NOT to invent page/volume/issue numbers, use null when uncertain, set confidence 0–100 per result, flag `ai_generated: true` on all. After parsing: runs citation guard on DOI-bearing results, stamps `provenance_label`, `doi_verified`, `requires_hitl` onto each result. `guardSummary` returned alongside results.

- **Literature APA Citation Guard** (`/api/literature`) [commit f010c09] — After generating APA citation: runs guard on the item's own DOI/URL. If CrossRef title mismatch: appends warning to `citation_apa` string. If `requires_hitl`: appends `[NEEDS MANUAL VERIFICATION]` to citation.

- **Citation Guard UI** (`/platform/research` — +60L) [commit bc4cef0] — Provenance badges visible in Research Search and Literature Library:
  - Search results: Guard banner above results showing verified/needs_review/fabricated_risk counts. Per-result badge (top-right): ✓ Verified (green) | ⚠ Unverified (amber) | ✗ Check manually (red)
  - Literature Library: Guard badge shown above APA citation box after generation. CrossRef mismatch warning + HITL reason shown inline if flagged.

### Platform Scale
- 20 pages · **33 routes** (+1: /api/research/verify)

## v1.4.0 — 2026-Q1

### New Features
- **Real Gmail Send** (`/api/email/send`) [commit e9a9f3c] — POST endpoint (152L) sends emails via Gmail API using the authenticated user's OAuth token. Retrieves and auto-refreshes Google access token from `user_profiles`. Builds RFC 2822 message (base64url encoded per Gmail API spec). Calls Gmail API `messages/send`. Handles `threadId` for replies within existing threads. Marks source `email_item` as 'actioned' after send. Returns specific error codes: `GOOGLE_NOT_CONNECTED`, `INSUFFICIENT_SCOPE`. Works with existing `gmail.modify` scope already requested in OAuth flow.
- **Privacy Policy page** (`/privacy`) [commit a298d35] — Standalone Privacy Policy page accessible without authentication.
- **Terms of Service page** (`/terms`) [commit a298d35] — Standalone Terms of Service page accessible without authentication.
- **Middleware public paths expanded** [commit a298d35, c7b7e75] — `/privacy`, `/terms`, `/auth/login`, `/auth/signup`, `/auth/verify` added to public bypass list. `next.config` build settings corrected for production compatibility.

### Platform Scale
- 20 pages (+2: /privacy, /terms) · 31 routes (+1: /api/email/send)

- **Admin Migrate SQL API** (`/api/admin/migrate/sql` — 37L) — serves raw migration SQL for copy/paste into Supabase SQL Editor
- **Signup/Onboarding flow** (`/auth/signup`, 195L) — new user registration with email/password, organisation name, role selection; email verification redirect

## v1.2.0 — 2026-Q1

### Bug Fixes
- **Build fix** (`payroll/detect/route.ts`, `brief/route.ts`) — Vercel build failures caused by `try {}` injected inside `Promise.all([...])` arrays from a bad merge. Both files restored to valid TypeScript. [commit 07b8e8c]

### New Features
